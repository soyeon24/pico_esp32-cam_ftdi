"""
A webcam standing in for the ESP32-CAM and the RP2040, so the posture stage can
be run and tuned without either board.

It is a port of what the two of them already do, in the same order and with the
same knobs, so what comes out is the thing the hardware would have sent:

    grey frame -> sigma-delta background -> |cur - bg| -> box down to 54x42
                                                              |
                  largest blob <- open <- fill holes <- threshold
                       |
                    mask + coverage

esp32cam_sender.ino owns the first row, vision.c the second. Numbers that differ
from the firmware defaults are called out where they are set.

This is a stand-in, not a simulator: a webcam's auto-exposure, its colour
processing and its resolution are all different, so thresholds tuned here still
want checking on the board. What it does reproduce faithfully is the *structure*
of the signal - in particular, that a brightness difference only marks a subject
where the subject differs in brightness, which is the interesting failure.
